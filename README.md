# Supervised Machine Learning Models: Performance Comparison

## Project Overview
This study focuses on comparing various supervised classification models to determine the best-performing model for a hotel reservation dataset. The models evaluated include:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- AdaBoost
- Random Forest
- Voting Classifier
- Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with and without batch processing

The dataset used for this comparison contains 36,275 instances and 19 features. The study highlights how different preprocessing techniques and model architectures impact the performance of these models. The findings indicate that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) show the best performance.
